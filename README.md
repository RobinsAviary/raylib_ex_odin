# raylib_ex_odin

Currently only for Windows (x64), as that's what I know how to build on.

Built on the [official binding](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/tree/master/vendor/raylib) from Odin.

Default screenshot key was updated to be `F2`.

`SetExitKey(key: KeyboardKey)`

`SetScreenshotKey(key: KeyboardKey)`

`GetExitKey() -> (key: KeyboardKey)`

`GetScreenshotKey() -> (key: KeyboardKey)`
